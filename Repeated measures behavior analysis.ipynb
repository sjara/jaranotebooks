    "In the amod experiments, we test animals using a behavioral paradigm where the type of auditory stimulus that must be discriminated varies from trial to trial. We have been using two types of auditory stimuli: chords of different frequencies, and amplitude-modulated noise with different modulation rates. The animal is required to discriminate low vs. high frequencies on trials where a chord is presented, and fast vs. slow modulation rates on trials where an AM sound is presented. We have been interleaving chord and AM trials so that the type of stimulus switches back and forth each trial. \n",

    "## What type of test we are going to use\n",
    "We want to have our model take into account that the performance starts at different levels. Then, we want to test whether allowing the effect of muscimol to differ between the two tasks explains more variance than modeling the effect of muscimol on the two tasks as the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "Statistically, we are going to use mixed-effect modeling to acheive this. We will include the sound type as a random effect, since we aren't interested in how the type of sound affected the subject's performance. Additionally, since outcomes are measured as number of successes vs. failures, we will have to do this as a logistic regression. So, we are looking at a generalized linear mixed-effect model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixed models\n",
    "**Note:** There are many more (and much better) explanations of mixed models and their applications out there. Check out some of the souces at the end of this section. \n",
    "\n",
    "In regression models, the goal is to estimate some parameter as a linear combination of predictor variables, multiplied by a set of regression coefficients. Mixed effect models break predictor variables into two classes: **fixed factors** and **random factors**. Fixed factors occur when you sample across the entire population you intend to study. For instance, if you are interested in comparing the battery life across 4 brands of batteries, then you sample from those 4 battery brands and use the brand as a fixed factor. In this case, the *population* is just the 4 brands of batteries that you are testing. However, if you are interested in learning something about the *larger population* of batteries as a whole, you can treat the brand as a **random effect**. In this case, any variation due to the different brands is not necessarily indicative of the entire population, beacuse you only have a small sample of 4 brands within that larger population. However, using this kind of model you can include data from the 4 different brands together in the same analysis, while accounting for the group-level variation that could occur between the different brands. A grouping variable can be modeled as a random effect if you aren't interested in evaluating its effect on the dependent variable directly, but want to take into account the covariance that will occur between samples in a group. These kinds of models are often used in biology because data are often collected in a way that leads to groupings: \n",
    "\n",
    "* An ecologist samples barnacles across 5 sites, counting 5 areas at each site. Data are grouped by site (site is a random factor).\n",
    "* A medical study performs tests on subjects many times over a period of years. In this type of experiment (repeated measures), data are grouped by individual (individual # is a random factor).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random intercepts vs. random slopes\n",
    "Within a mixed effect model, there are two ways that you can specify a random effect. The random effect may only change the intercept for each group by some amount, while leaving the slope (coefficient value) for each regression term the same between all groups. Alternatively, the model can allow both the intercept and the slope of the regression to vary between the groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The test we will perform\n",
    "We are interested in whether the effect of muscimol varies across a grouping variable, the sound type. The effect of muscimol is what we are interested in, so that will be a fixed factor. We aren't really interested in whether the type of sound affects the performance on the task, but observations collected from within each sound type group will be correlated with each other. So, we will treat sound type as a random factor. The question we will test is whether it is better to use a *random intercept* model or a *random slope* model to explain the additional variance due to the different sound types. If a random intercept model is sufficient, then we will accept the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the size of the effect (slope, or coefficient value) of muscimol between the different sound types. However, if a random slope model has a significantly better goodness-of-fit, then we will reject the null hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The plan:**\n",
    "Compare a model with random slopes (allowing the muscimol to have a different effect on chord performance and tone performance) to a model with just random intercepts (allowing chord and tone performance to start at a different level, but assuming the same effect of muscimol on each). If the random slope model explains significantly more variance than the random intercepts model, then we can conclude that the effect of muscimol is different on the two sound types. \n",

    "### Using R inside Python to fit statistical models\n",
    "While the python package `statsmodels` provides support for linear mixed-effect models and generalized linear models via a simple `function` api, the available Python implemenations of generalized linear mixed-effect models are pretty confusing (see: https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/mixed_glm.html). I don't have time to get into the weeds learning how to implement the models in Python, so I am going to use R to do it. The implementation in R is straightforward and uses the familiar function syntax. We will use the rpy2 module to run R code from our Python kernel (https://rpy2.readthedocs.io/en/version_2.8.x/)"

    "In a single animal, `amod003`, we found that the effect of muscimol inactivation on the ratio of correct to incorrect trials varied between the two sound types, with the muscimol coefficient estimate being slightly less negative for the Chords than for the AM sounds. However, a separate analysis of subject `amod002` did not lead us to reject the null hypothesis that the effect of muscimol is the same between both sound types. When we combined the data from these two animals into a single model (a strength of the generalized linear mixed-effect model) we similarly found that we could not reject the null hypothesis that the effect of muscimol is consistent across sound types. \n",
